# AgroDrone Vision MVP

**A Systems + AI Project for Smart Agricultural Monitoring**

## ðŸŒ± Project Summary

AgroDrone Vision MVP is a compact, portfolio-driven prototype designed to showcase technical fluency in both **computer vision (Python + OpenCV)** and **systems engineering (IBM DOORS + Rhapsody)**. Itâ€™s aimed at solving real-world problems in rural and agricultural tech through drone footage analysis.

The project highlights a hybrid approach, combining AI prototyping with model-based systems engineering (MBSE), and sets the foundation for a potential startup idea.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

**Primary Goal:**
- Build a prototype that analyzes drone video to extract useful insights (e.g., row detection, terrain segmentation)

**Secondary Goals:**
- Use Python + OpenCV for basic vision processing
- Apply systems modeling with IBM Rhapsody (SysML)
- Capture stakeholder/system requirements in IBM DOORS
- Practice clean documentation and modular development
- Create a product-facing angle (roadmap, user stories)
