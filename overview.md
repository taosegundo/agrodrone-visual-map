# Product Overview – AgroDrone Vision MVP

## 🚜 Problem Statement

Traditional agricultural monitoring methods are manual, time-consuming, and lack real-time insights. There is a growing need for **autonomous, vision-driven solutions** that can assist farmers with crop and terrain analysis at scale — especially in underserved rural regions.

---

## 🌟 Vision

To create a **modular, vision-based drone prototype** that can analyze aerial footage and highlight key features like crop rows, terrain boundaries, and anomalies. This lightweight MVP serves as a foundation for future tools in **precision agriculture**.

---

## 🎯 Target Users

- Farmers and agricultural cooperatives
- Rural tech innovators/startups
- Academic researchers in agri-tech
- Policy or NGO stakeholders in food/agriculture

---

## 🧰 Key Features (MVP Scope)

- Drone video ingestion (recorded or live)
- Frame-by-frame processing via OpenCV
- Basic anomaly detection (e.g., bare soil, gaps)
- System engineering documentation (SysML + DOORS)
- Optional web interface (Streamlit)

---

## 🚧 Limitations

- Does not support real-time processing (yet)
- Requires drone video input (no drone integration in MVP)
- Vision models are basic and not fine-tuned

---

## 🔭 Future Potential

- Integrate live drone feeds and onboard processing
- Expand CV techniques (e.g., deep learning models)
- Add multi-sensor input (thermal, moisture, etc.)
- Extend for pest detection or irrigation monitoring

---

## 📍 Next Steps

- Finalize MVP processing pipeline (OpenCV)
- Model system structure in Rhapsody
- Document requirements in IBM DOORS
- Build dashboard prototype (if time permits)
